what feature? face id? You're face scanned and recognized by apple and even the government save on their data base. Convenient for people who don't have issues with their privacy being compromise. I'd admit it has a powerful processor but the restriction, not open access a deal breaker for some people. If you're comfortable with IOS it's a good phone, the most powerful phone at the moment I'd say. The price you ask, I think their asking too much for the phone.

Your logic is flawed. They do slow down the older phones, but it isn't without a reason. Most older phones have been out for years and people have had them for years. I had the original six until I got the Iphone X. The problem is with ANY older phone is that because of apps using more than ever before in terms of RAM, Etc. Most phones don't last 6 hour let alone a day.
 
While I don't agree that Apple hasn't offered the choice, it is a clever decision because that if you look on Apple's top reviews is the main complaint(Apart from the price, but those complaints aren't really viable or relatable to this).
 
Please in future, do not post illogical and radical conclusions without first inserting the slightest bit on knowledge.
 
Have a nice day,

138,24-Dec-17,"To sum up: The iPhone X is awesome device, and so are other iPhones. They maybe did had downsides like no wireless charging or lacks of features, but with recent iPhones that's not the case. Also the RAM managment and software optimization are unmatched. And security/privacy on iOS is much better too. 
But, now there is the catch. It does cost a lot, which is also even understandable because of what it brings to the table. But at this price ranges, there shouldn't be much to complain about. But there is, from non expanding storage to iTunes and now to Apple slowing down old models performance. Say whatever you want - but they do that to make money, to force you to upgrade to better phone. Slow charger you get with iPhone X or removal of headphone jack is just an example of it. From no customization which sucks, now we are coming to other stuff that Apple does to make more money out of you. The same goes with the insane costs to replace front and/or back glass on new iPhones. They are innovative, and they could make even better products, but they are more interested in profit.

The soup WAS good, don't get me wrong, but the glory of my sandwich overshadowed the whole affair. 
My friend even goes so far as to say that it is the BIGGEST regret of his adult life and that he has ordered the sandwich multiple times since then and that it has never been made to the same glorious standards as the first time he laid his envious eyes upon it.  He has since fallen out with me as I never let him taste even the smallest bite of this magical creation.  i have received several threatening emails and lewd phone calls asking me to explain the feelings associated with eating the sandwich of sandwiches.  I can only decline to do this as re-living this visceral experience will probably drive me to very edge of my own sanity, even the brief memory of the enticing aroma is enough to push me close to the greatest moment of my life and, in that moment, i maybe tempted to end my thoughts there and slip into the bliss that was the perfectly seasoned mayonnaise dressed Excalibur Sandwich, a Sandwich fit for a king.

Even worse that some websites have started giving discounts of 2000/- to 5000/- . Google understood its position and worth in the Indian market and Pixel 2 was discounted to Rs 39990/- .

AMOLED also have limitations but Apple beat most of them. If you compare iPhone 8 LCD and iPhone X screen, only thing where iPhone 8 is better is viewing angle colour shift. But even that iPhone X has best in the market from AMOLED screens.

No, they were afraid that they get those super punchy oversatured colours, iOS devices are big favourite among graphic and visual persons.

Apple is always provided best tools for us creative people. How you think i can edit photo If it the look is already sowmthing how i shot it? I have no idea how it will look after i send it to another device If the devices colors were wrong from the beginning. This is exact same why musicians doesn't buy punchy speakers, they buy studio monitors which offers most balanced and natural sound. Not having too punchy bass or too crispy high end, the sound has to be perfectly flat and natural and sorry in mobile phones, Samsung doesn't offer that.

I have X and then i have iPad Pro, Yes X have better screen. Both look very similar, just the colours are deeper and black is really black. If you take Android phone with OLED screen next to those, it doesn't look similar. You are going to see big differences.
 
Like i said Apple combined best of both worlds.

""According to DisplayMate, the iPhone X has the highest color accuracy of any smartphone display, the highest full-screen brightness for OLED smartphones, the highest full-screen contrast rating in ambient light, the highest contrast ratio, the lowest screen reflectance, and the smallest brightness variation with viewing angle changes.

Do you have any evidence that young people are less tech savvy than the older generations? This seems contradictory to what the evidence out there suggests. 
 
""On the 6th October you posted here (one of many posts from you slating the IPhone X) 
Ahhh, I'll pass on the X, who knows what post production issues that phone will present. IPhone 8 batteries are expanding and popping off the screens. I guess this is apples year for issues. I knew years back that apple purchases cheap batteries. I've had both my iPhone 4 and laptops batteries expand and pop open. I'm with the Samsung 8 and I think I'll stay right there. I know Samsung had a Note 7 issues however they did well in taking care of their customers through that whole episode. You don't see apple stepping up and recalling their iPhone 8""s. I guess they're waiting for something really bad to happen. Money always wins over people with apple""

Why do you now have in your possession an IPhone X based on what you have said in the past?
 
You claim that the young are blindly buying the IPhone X.... so how on earth do you, as an older more knowledgeable person, have an IPhone X?

My advise would be to take it back as soon as possible, the quicker you do this the better.

 ItÂ?s not that itÂ?s not working but the ratio of  it working perfectly is 60-70%. Sometimes it recognises, the other it doesnÂ?t even if u hold the phone in same circumstance ( light distance etc).

It too got a little slower into its second year but not as bad as the s2. I replaced the s4 with an s6 and kept it for 2 years and it was perfect. No lags or slowing down, a massive improvement over the s2 and also an improvement over the s4. I now have an s8 and it is just superb in every way - speed, screen, camera etc. It certainly suits my purpose and proves that competition eventually brings out the best in everything.

436,22-Nov-17,"The reason I stick with Apple year after year, even though they consistently fail to add or change features I would like and could have on an Android device, is stability. ThatÂ?s it. I need my phone to work, consistently, especially for the core functions of a communication device - email, text, Internet, messaging apps, etc.  I switched from Android with the iPhone 4 because it blew every existing Android device away in terms of speed and reliability in daily use.  Benchmarks are and were irrelevant to me; they donÂ?t console me when my phone freezes or reboots itself, when apps crash or fail to load or get sluggish, when messages mysteriously dissolve or fail to send.  These are problems I have never had on an iPhone. The Â?it just worksÂ? factor becomes really important when you rely on a device for critical communication for business. These days there are really impressive Android phones that seem to beat the iPhone out of the gate, even in actual speed tests and daily use case scenarios. But I know people who actually own those devices and I *still* see them stutter and fail at important tasks on occasion - something I literally never experience as an iOS user. Yes, bugs have creeped into iOS in recent iterations (which have generally been quickly squashed). But nothing which has caused slowdown or failure of essential tasks. And Android phones suffer from another frustrating problem IÂ?ve never experienced in iOS: slowdown over time. IÂ?ve never had to fully restore an iOS device to get it running without lag again. Ever. But that seems to be commonplace among Android devices. O donÂ?t have time in my life to be fiddling with my phone to get it running how I need it to work. Every cool and supposedly more convenient new feature that comes out on Android May seem like a reason to switch, but it always comes back to reliability for me. Over the course of my workday, I just need stuff to work how it should work when I want to use it, even if itÂ?s a fairly vanilla version of the thing. ThatÂ?s what keeps in in the iOS ecosystem.

557,14-Nov-17,"Alex, 12 Nov 2017Iphone 8 and 8 Plus should be 7s and 7s plus
And iphone x should be iphone 8Yes I agree as I already said, Apple and Samsung were two of the last companies to hold the physical home button when everyone else adopted on screen buttons, this year both companies decided to get rid of home buttons in their flagships and what we got to know about each one's approach. 
Samsung removed the home button but tried to keep the overall experience same for its users. The back button on right side tho it can be changed to left now. A recent apps button and a 3d touch always on home button which wasn't seen in any phone till now, iPhone 7 had it but it wasn't embedded in the display itself. So a Samsung user coming from older models like S5, S6 or S7 will get almost the same experience. The fingerprint sensor was put to back this time but the phone can still be unlocked the same way, press the always on home button without waking up the phone while looking at the display and the phone will be unlocked in no time by the iris scanner giving an impression of inbuilt fingerprint sensor. The bottom navigation panel with back home and recent buttons can be hidden easily by two taps tho the home button will still be functioning on pressing the area where it's embedded giving the same experience of physical home button while watching videos, playing games and using any app. The overall experience was enhanced by options like swipe down anywhere on display for notification panel and swipe up anywhere for apps, these settings can be changed according to taste.  
The other one is Apple which being the first company to bring 3d touch and a 3d touch home button in iPhone 7 strangely couldn't implement an always on 3d touch home button in display in their most premium phone till date. What they came up with is a swipe up line which is a user nightmare. To ruin it more there are things like swipe down from left of notch for notification, from right of notch for control center. The experience is no where near what people are used to and what they'll be using in future when inbuilt fingerprint sensor will come. The unlocking takes more time now due to the swipe even after face verification. Apple's rushed software approach for an anniversary edition makes an arrogant image of Apple. They are saying like'' if you want a phone which has demanded features samsung's display and bezel-less design then you'll have to pay extra and will have to accept unfinished non practical software. Otherwise keep buying what we are giving you from years and don't complain ''. I think and everyone thinks that iPhone x was supposed to be the main device of the year, they could name it as iPhone 8,X or anything but it was supposed to in the place of iPhone 8 as the next iPhone. It's a direct competitior to S8 which is a usual successor of previous device not an anniversary edition sold at premium price. Apple + amoled and unfinished software can't make it a more expensive device than the current iPhone of the year.

They could choose more expensive curved displays (570 ppi as in S8) but Apple decided to save cost and put a normal display in a curved glass panel which could easily fit a curved display as rumored earlier. Apple did the software tweaks and now the display is same as a lcd which means you get a lcd like oled with added risk of burn ins and lines as the software isn't revamped to avoid burn ins like Samsung do by slightly moving icons and buttons and moving always on features to avoid burn ins.

579,12-Nov-17,"Its iPhone tenth anniversary time and Apple had to think diffferent to commemorate it. The iPhone X attempts to setup a change in the design language and UI gestures for the next few years.  Of course when you have a massive user base making big changes means bringing those users with you. Yes things will probably change a bit based on user feedback, this is a Gen 1 product, and yes the software will catch up with the hardware - Animoji is just a fun proof of concept to push developers to come up with their own ideas.
 
Having finally got one (thanks istocknow.com for the live stock pushes!) my initial thoughts are this. Screen is something else. Oled looks very good, but Ive noticed my iPad Pro screen looks better in any light than my 6S plus scree, and this seems to prove Truetone/HDR is key.
 
I admit I was a bit worried about losing Touch ID but amazingly FaceID seems to work at least as well as TouchID (shame you cant register two faces - I guess the bionic ML hardware isnt fast enough - A12 anyone - or the software isnt up to it yet?), and its quicker to setup.
 
Speed is well ... wow ... just like the iPad Pro 10.5. Cameras ... amazing for such a small device but no comparison to a DLSR (though those can be thousands with good lenses!). However, its a big improvement on the 6S plus and I thought that had a good camera. 
 
Is it worth the equivalent price of a 12 next week inch MacBook? Thats a personal decision but if you dont want to spend quite that much but want an iPhone, the iPhone 8 (and even 7) are mighty good phones with most of the functionality and very good LCD screens. But if you really really really want a X then consider the Apple Upgrade Programme. Its a way of paying monthly, its 0%, you get Applecare Plus, and you can upgrade to the Gen 2 product next year if you want or just continue paying it off.",Anonymous

Then moved iPhone... Thought it is the greatest - I was wrong.. Even for basic operations - I was severely constrained. For instance, how do I take a backup of Photos physically (File copy) to PC ? It was virtually impossible unless you do it the ""iTunes"" way... And the backup to iCloud ? I paid close to USD1150 for this phone. And yet, I need to pay a subscription cost to iCloud - just for photo backup.. I paid unwillingly. 
 
Go to iTunes, they try to hard sell Apple Music .. I just don't need it.

Redmi Note 4 is (true) not officially water or dust resistant, but features 1GB more RAM than X. Camera is good enough, 4K videos at 30fps are not a problem. No optical zoom, true, but if that's needed, one should pick DSLR anyway, dual cam - useless. Screen resolution is much better, as it's standartized, unlike that of iP X. 5Mpix front camera is still OK for 1080p video.  
No stereo speakers, true, but unneeded. No NFC, true, but most cards are unsupported so not really needed. 
No wireless charging, true, yet still it's not practical and voice recognition is governed by Google or third parties.  
On the other hand RMN4 has a headphone socket, IR port, 6 programmable buttons, fingerprint reader, dual sim and unlocked bootloader - all of which are more practical and all of which are lacking on iPhone X.

732,6-Nov-17,"Got the handset on release day on Friday. 
Visually the handset looks like a top for the range phone-it should do for that price tag.  
The feel is also high quality. Truly a thing of beauty.  
Used it quite a lot over the weekend, more than i usually would with my handset. 
So far i've had no problems and everything works very well.  
I was a little worried about FaceID but it works perfectly. Apple wouldn't have used it in the handset if they weren't 100% satisfied with the tech behind it.  
The camera is very impressive too. Other phones have better cameras i appreciate that but this phone is rocking a pretty decent camera though.  
Overall a very happy Apple customer (so far). things may change and something might go wrong but so far, so good for me.

We are those who do intensive testing without damaging the phone to know day to day heavy use by everyone what are the normal issues... software issues are just normal and can be just resolved by updates

Iphone x did have issues.. when you scroll up to unlock the device which they have replaced it with touch id.. is the one which is the weakest spot and in the tests we dont think this phone can cross 1 year without issues 
The screen too lags doesnt work  
And trust me in the upcoming iphones they will have to resolve this issue with heat pipe which keeps the phone cool which samsung uses inside their phones 
Also fingerprint scan through the power button i bet they will have to come up as the phone is useless  if faceid stops or touchscreen doesnt work so atleast can open with fingerprint sensor through power button

Why iPhone X and not go for a Samsung or other brand, well, it's not the sheep mentality, and it's not a case of iPhone being better than Samsung's flagship phone, it's more about personal preference. It's about the fact that I feel comfortable and prefer the Apps, iTunes and other support software that provide the experience of using/ owning an iPhone.

There is no away around the fact that the sharpness on the iPhone X will pale in comparison to competition. The iPhone 8 Plus will be slightly better and more comparable to the 2K OLED displays out there, but even it will be dwarfed by the 2K RGB LCD displays.

1255,3-Oct-17,"ThereÂ?s a growing trend in smartphone design that slices and dices the screen in shapes that stray further and further from the traditional rectangle. Rounded corners are a relatively tiny change and an old one at that (the Palm Pre had rounded corners). 
But then companies like LG, Essential and then Apple started cutting off larger portions. LG did it to fit a Â?secondary screenÂ? on the same line as the selfie camera, Essential just jammed the selfie camera in the top row of the screen and Apple was even more aggressive. 
And our readers want none of that Â? only a quarter of voters are okay with any sort of screen cutout. ItÂ?s a roughly even split between those who only accept small cutouts and those that will agree to a big chunk of their screen being taken away in the name of a great feature. 
Still, the overwhelming portion of the vote Â? 60% - went to the Rounded corners option. It is curious that the traditional rectangular screen got relatively weak support. We think this means that rounded corners are in as a design element.",user

1315,28-Sep-17,"Anticipation of the X is killing the sales of the 8. 
 
People whining about a new design every year should look at Apple's other products. Has the MacBook and iPad changed much in design the last 7-10 years? Yet, nobody complains about bezels on TVs and desktop displays. Only iPhones where people whine about new designs.
 
The rat race to get the X before the year ends and spend $200 more over the 8 Plus which essentially has same specs as the X is for people to chase this ego-driven feeling of having it before more people have it. But after awhile, X is as common as the 5s and 6 design.

2018 - XI

Keep the naming simple even if the design is the same. X is able to reboot the naming for iPhones. Only the iPhone 4 was named properly for the generation it was released. The 4s, 5s, and 6s, ruined the generation order.

and so expensive to buy 1000!! believ... moreIts not about the spec. The price is justified with the following reasons.
 
1. The A11 chip is super fast, even par with latest MacBook pro performance. this phone will be fresh for next 5 years (I derived this from my iPhone 5S bought 4 years back but still working great specifically super fast with latest iOS 11)
 
 2. Apple continuously putting efforts to revamp the underneath stuffs. Example the current iOS 11 comes with AFS file system which is totally safe, reliable and provides super fast performance. They revamped the total File system that supports 4 years old phone too...
 
3. Apple support. If anything happens within the warranty period, no questions asked you can get a replacement
 
4. Also Apple is supporting the 4 year old iPhone 5s with the new image and file format that improves the quality as well as cut the image / video size to half. 
 
5. The Note 8 also expensive with $930 and the iPhone comes with $999 tag. $70 difference only but you can get a phone for 5 year (if you are not tempted to buy new one between) I am sure after 2 years Note 8 will be slow down and eventually will die within 3 years.
 
You just think the above points and take a call whether the difference of $70 is expensive.

The iphone x still has bezels which id rather have than a screen going all the way to the edges. Its more ergonomic to hold with accidental screen touches not being an annoyance. Also adds structural strength and rigidity to the device. Edge to edge screens only looks nice but adds no practicality to it.

1465,20-Sep-17,"Every year around this time Apple releases its new iPhones and every year we get a few early reviews in just before the phone goes on sale. 
But this time, Apple has a more interesting phone coming out in November - the iPhone X - casting a shadow over the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus - are they still worth it with a design dating back to 2014? Let's see what the reviewers say.
 
The consensus is that the Apple iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are let down by a tired design that's built on huge bezels and familiar aesthetics, but the new camera, wireless charging and chip partially make up for it. 
Engadget praises the iPhone 8 duo on the new excellent camera and a promising AR implementation but takes a point away for the design, despite the use of ""grippier"" glass. 
TheVerge makes mostly the same points - fast new processor, excellent camera and having wireless charging is nice. But Nilay Patel isn't too thrilled with the stiff design either. 
TechCrunch focuses on the new camera of the iPhone 8 Plus in their review hailing the new 12MP main camera as killer and the 8 Plus's Portrait Lighting as ""working better than it has any right to"". 
The same theme continues with The Telegraph - praise for the significantly improved camera and the new faster chipset. The new glass back gets a positive mention too. 
The New York Times review brands the new iPhones as the ""ultimate refinement before eternal retirement"". 
The Wall Street Journal (subscription required) is the only media that outright advises you avoid the iPhone 8 on the grounds that the 8 doesn't do enough to be considered more than a 7s, slightly better camera notwithstanding. 
John Gruber aka the Daring Fireball brands the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus ""pretty good for a boring update"". 
CNET would have you wait to see the iPhone X before deciding on buying either an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus. 
In its brief write-up USA Today describes the new glass and metal design as ""lovely"". 
Wired shares TechCrunch' sentiment that the new camera is kick-ass. It also hails the glass design as a big improvement coupled with wireless charging.

Sure, this phone isn't anything hugely special, but it's still a huge step in the right direction for Apple, which has been stagnant for years now.
 
A lot of people live the design. Personally, on the internet I think it looks nice enough, though if place it behind both the galaxy phones and the mi mix. In real life I might like it more, I didn't like how tall and thin the s8 was. Plenty of people will consider this the most beautiful phone - especially those with Samsung hate.
 
The processor is a gamble. On paper, it looks to be a huge leap on existing tech. But you're correct that it's had limited testing, can't wait to see the heat generation.
 
Copy Samsung's screen? It is Samsung's screen - nothing wrong with that. Probably the best mobile screens around, so good going Apple.
 
Overall, I think the phone is nothing exciting, but it does compete with the best phones out there.

It's not the hardware specs that make a product a great one. What you are going to do with the product matters more than raw power. You could have 16 core CPU and a 16GB RAM on your phone but what's the point if you can manage to pull off most tasks that are available today with just 2 or 3GB RAM tops. Take Samsung's face detection based unlock for example. People could easily break it with a simple photo/picture to unlock. Apple has gone really far in order to make face ID fool proof. At least they have attempted. We'll know how secure it is once the phone is out and security enthusiasts take a dig at it.

Let's try a simplification. Imagine to have a software that, whenever a red square is presented, it returns the word 'Red'. Then you change a little bit the input color so it is very close to the original red. And you program the software to write again 'Red'. Then you extend this 'learning' path of this computer software so that a number of degrees of differences of the original red is sill mapped to the output word 'Red'. At the end of this learning process your software will be able to 'recognize' an input color and decides if it has to return the 'Red' word as output or another string. Now, substitute the input color with the dots that map your face and the output string returned by the software with the lock/unlock mechanism of the new iPhone and here you are...

1759,13-Sep-17,"With iPhone X preorders in 6 weeks and availability sometime after that, it leaves a large window for discussions about the pros and cons of this device. Apple is for the most part targeting current and past iPhone users. They're not likely to attract many crossover android users since most of the new features on this device have been components on android smartphones for some time now at a significantly lower price point. Facial Recognition, Wireless Charging, Imersive LED Display and Glass Body among others. A good portion of the early debate has revolved around cost. Even longtime iPhone devotees are going to think twice about the cost/value metric. Not only for the X flagship between $999.00 and $1,149.00 but even more so for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus which are priced at $699.00 and $799.00 respectively. By the time you buy Earpods, Lighting Dock, Wireless Charger and a Case you'll have invested over $1,300.00 for the 64 GB and $1,450.00 for a 256 GB iPhone X and between $1,000.00 to $1,100.00 for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.

With its massive display the iPhone X is one of the flagship phone with the smallest pixel density 458ppi vs. 537ppi for the LG V30 or 521ppi for the Note 8.
 
Based on this it is obvious to me that Apple don't take augmented reality seriously. How would Android fans turn to Apple when they persist in their avoidance of high resolution displays?
 
LG was able to fit a 3300mAh battery in a really thin device. Why can't Apple finally build a battery in that will allow them to have better autonomy at high resolutions and deliver a more comfortable augmented reality experience? 
 
It could have been a justified choice if they were going to make the phone a battery beast (what everyone is craving for the moment) but they haven't even provided the battery capacity yet, so don't even expect them to use the smaller display resolution to outperform Android in terms of autonomy. Lost opportunity in my opinion.
 
The Note 8 is too heavy and I don't like the elongated square design that much. 
The iPhone X doesn't join the high resolution display club and won't have the crazy batter size that people were hoping for. 
Neither have an emphasis on audio quality.
 
For me it will be either LG V30 or Axon 9. As much as I love the LG V30, I would prefer a dual stereo speaker setup but it will depend on ZTE'S ability to fit them in a bezelless design.
 
But at least those two brands put on emphasis on audio and microphone quality. What good is great camera if the recorded sound is not even remotely professional grade?

Had nearly every Android flagship in last 10 years. Only stayed away from Apple due to large screen to body ratio (and not only Apple to be fair - Sony and few others are on the list as well.)  
This time we have serious IPhone available and I am tempted for first time in years. Say what you want about IOS but it is still most stable and most supported system for phones/tablets. Maybe you don't use any pro apps but if you do you will find out that Android is poor at best - I work in music industry and what IOS achieved around music based apps is unbelievable. And this is possible due to stability and great IOS - no Android app is able to run steadily enough so it can be used for live music like we use on iPads - and that is a sign of great system. Sometimes is not about numbers but about reliability. I have LG G6 and Samsung S8 right now and both these things started to slow down and random moments and that is only about 3 months into use. Great phones - agree, but poor creative / professional tools. ",Anonymous
